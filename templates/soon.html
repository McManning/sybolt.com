        In order to better aggregate and manage data across multiple services, a user account system will be introduced for frequent users to create a single account for managing multiple identities across provided services. This came directly out of a need to determine who-is-who across multiple services in order to better integrate each Sybolt service into a single platform.
        </p>
        <p>
        By creating a profile on Sybolt, you will gain access to personalized Minecraft statistics, movie night recommendations, event notifications, Mumble post history, and many upcoming features that would not be available to the usual visitor.

        Registered users will be able to manage their statistics, start and restart the main server, as well as load any previous world played for that bit of nostalgia, or change of scenery.

        Due to the sheer volume of posts made in the Sybolt Mumble server, we will be introducing a searchable, filterable historical record of the Mumble server. This includes images, links, and videos searchable by date, type, user, and more. Registered users will have the ability to review their own posts, and remove them, or use them, how they see fit. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, useful data will be aggregated out of the Mumble server and used to better the user experience throughout the Sybolt platform. In less marketing terms; movie suggestions within Mumble will find their way onto Live, as well as information about games and other activities that could be enjoyed by everyone.

        To improve upon the weekly movie night, Live will be upgraded with a calendar of movies played and information about who's up next and what they picked (if known beforehand). Registered users will also have the ability to join the rotation, add recommendations, search through recommendations, and overall have an easier experience when picking a movie everyone would enjoy. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When not actually streaming "live", the Live page will also act as YetAnotherSyncTube, for anyone to add a video (from known video hosts) and watch with others simultaneously.
